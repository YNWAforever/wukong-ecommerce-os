## Shopline delivery

Shopline delivery is the listing decision that determines whether a specific
listing version may be delivered through `shopline_api` or CSV. The decision
uses one workspace-scoped view of the listing, active version, review flags,
connection metadata, and current publish job.

The decision is bound to the exact active-version ID and content digest. The
worker re-evaluates the same decision after queueing. An unavailable Shopline
connection produces an explicit CSV fallback; delivery never switches methods
silently.
